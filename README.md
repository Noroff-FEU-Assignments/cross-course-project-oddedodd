NOROFF - Cross Course Project

## Description

This project marked my first significant endeavor, initially conceived as an assignment for the HTML/CSS course at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. The primary objective was to develop a responsive website for an online store, utilizing a prototype I had previously designed with Figma during a Design course. This project not only served as a practical application of my design skills but also as a foundation for integrating various technical competencies acquired throughout my coursework.

Spanning multiple courses, this project evolved into a comprehensive cross-course initiative. Initially focused on HTML and CSS, the project was subsequently enhanced with the knowledge I gained from several other courses. In the JavaScript course, I learned how to add dynamic functionalities to the website, making it more interactive and user-friendly. The Interaction Design (IxD) course provided insights into creating intuitive user experiences, ensuring that the website was not only visually appealing but also easy to navigate. Additionally, the Content Management Systems (CMS) course introduced me to efficient ways of managing and organizing content, which was crucial for handling the extensive product listings of the online store.

Technically, the project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For content management, it leverages the WordPress WooCommerce API, which allows for seamless integration of e-commerce functionalities. This choice of tools and technologies ensured that the website was robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

The WordPress API is hosted on FlyWheel, providing a reliable and secure platform for managing the back-end processes. For the deployment of the website, I chose Netlify, which offers a streamlined and efficient deployment process, ensuring that updates and changes to the site could be easily managed and published. This combination of hosting and deployment platforms allowed me to focus on developing and refining the website, knowing that the underlying infrastructure was both solid and dependable.

Overall, this project was a significant learning experience, allowing me to apply and integrate various skills and knowledge areas into a cohesive, functional, and visually appealing website. It provided a practical demonstration of how different aspects of web development and design come together to create a complete and professional online presence.
